We are holding our mass meeting at the Coliseum tomorrow.
As returning members of the club, feel free to set up strips and start fencing on the opposite side of the gym. This will make good use of practice time and allow newbies to walk in and immediately see some fencing in real life.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to U-M Fencing!</title><link>https://www.um-fencing.com/welcome/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.um-fencing.com/welcome/</guid><description>Welcome to the University of Michigan Fencing team!

We are not only eager to defend our title as the USACFC national champions, but we want everyone on campus to have the opportunity to join our club, learn how to fence, and take fencing with them for the rest of their lives.
One of our top priorities is investing in the future to create a growing and sustainable organization.</description></item><item><title>About Fencing</title><link>https://www.um-fencing.com/about_fencing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2016 14:07:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.um-fencing.com/about_fencing/</guid><description>The sport of fencing has three weapons: foil, epee and saber. The object of a fencing bout (what an individual &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; is called) is to land a specified number of touches on your opponent before he/she scores that number on you. Each bout is officiated by a referee called a director.
Electric Scoring All official tournaments are conducted using electric scoring systems. The fencers connect themselves, their blades, and their metal jackets (lames) to a retractable cord (reel), which plugs in to a scoring machine (pictured left).</description></item><item><title>Join</title><link>https://www.um-fencing.com/join/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2016 14:00:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.um-fencing.com/join/</guid><description>Already attended a practice?
