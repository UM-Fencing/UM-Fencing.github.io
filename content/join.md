No experience is necessary, and all equipment is provided by the team!

We have a Mass Meeting early each Fall for interested newcomers.
Look for our booths at Rec Sports Day and at Festifall for more information.
If you cannot attend the Mass Meeting, simply attend any practice.

# What to Wear
Normal gym attire is acceptable.
Foil and sabre fencers usually wear shorts.
Epee fencers prefer to wear pants for added protection since the legs are a target area.

# Dues
Dues are paid per semester and cost $100 for returning members and $75 for first time members.
They should be given to the Treasurer with three weeks of the start of the semester.
Members not affiliated with the university will need to pay an additional $60 for a pass to enter the Sports Coliseum.
Dues are nonrefundable.

# Tournaments
Each year, the fencing team travels to tournaments around the Midwest.
The team is highly competitive and challenges some of the best teams in the country, club and varsity.

Tournament fees and most travel expenses are paid for out of club dues; however, competitors need to bring money for food and gas.
In addition, those who compete will need to purchase or borrow their own pair of knickers and long white socks.
We highly recommended that each member of the team purchase a glove and mask as well.
Fencers who intend to compete frequently are encouraged, but not required, to purchase their own equipment.
