No experience is necessary, and all equipment is provided by the team!

We have a Mass Meeting early each Fall for interested newcomers.
Look for our booths at Rec Sports Expo and at Festifall for more information.
If you cannot attend the Mass Meeting, simply attend any practice.

If you're joining us later or haven't been receiving emails, please check the [archive](email-archive/).

# What to Wear
Normal gym attire is acceptable.
Foil and sabre fencers usually wear shorts.
Epee fencers must wear pants or knickers with socks for added protection since the legs are target area.

# Dues
Dues are paid per semester and cost $100 for returning members and $80 for first time members.
They should be given to the Treasurer with three weeks of the start of the semester.
Dues are nonrefundable.

# Membership
We impose no membership restrictions beyond those of the University of Michigan Recreational Sports and Club Sports departments.
In short, all members must be students, faculty, or staff at the University (including Flint and Dearborn campuses) with proof of medical insurance.

To become a member for a term of the University of Michigan Fencing Club, one must pay the term's membership dues as announced by the Officers.
There are no tryouts or cuts for members.
Fencers of all skill levels are welcome to join the Club.
There is no attendance requirement for members to remain.

# Tournaments
Each year, the fencing team travels to tournaments around the Midwest.
The team is highly competitive and challenges some of the best teams in the country, club and varsity.

Tournament fees and most travel expenses covered by a combination of club dues and travel fees (usually between $20 and $30).
Those traveling should also bring money for food. (Lunch is provided by the team.)

In addition, those who compete will need a full set of fencing gear, including weapons, body cords, a glove, jacket, knickers, socks, and underplastron.
