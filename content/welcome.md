Welcome to the University of Michigan Fencing team!
Whether you're a new or returning member, we look forward to having you.

This page will be helpful to you in (re)joining the club, receiving all important information throughout the year, and getting to know your teammates.

# Becoming a Member
Please follow these steps to become a member of the club this term. *All members, including those returning, must complete these annually!*

1. **Health insurance:** Obtain health insurance if you are not currently covered.
The University [offers insurance](https://www.uhs.umich.edu/dship) to students at the beginning of each term.

1. **Maize Pages:** Join our Maize Pages organization by navigating to [our page][Maize Page] and selecting "Join organization".
An officer will approve your request shortly.
*Returning members need not complete this step.*

1. **Participation Agreement:** After joining us on Maize Pages, scroll to the "Forms" section to find this year's Participation Agreement.
Please complete it to become an official member of our roster.
A photo of your health insurance card is required for completion.
This _must_ be submitted and approved before traveling, and facility supervisors begin to disallow those not on the roster shortly after the beginning of the term; complete this early to avoid missing fencing.
*All members must complete this, including those returning!*

1. **Dues:** The officers shall announce dues and a date by which they should be paid.
Dues may be paid to the club Treasurer by cash or check (made out to "The Regents of the University of Michigan" with "fencing" in the memo).
