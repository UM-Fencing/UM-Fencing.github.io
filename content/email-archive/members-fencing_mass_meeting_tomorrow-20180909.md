Dear All,

We are holding our mass meeting at the Coliseum tomorrow.

As returning members of the club, feel free to set up strips and start
fencing on the opposite side of the gym. This will make good use of
practice time and allow newbies to walk in and immediately see some fencing
in real life.

Thanks and see you all tomorrow,  
Zach Zipper  
UMFC Secretary

A couple more reminders for today:

Please wear something showing you are an experienced member of the club
with some of our apparel or even regular Michigan apparel. We want our
newcomers to feel comfortable approaching us and asking questions.

If you would like to participate in the fencing demonstrations, please let
your respective captain know (myself, Michael, Zach/Josh).

See you all in a bit,  
Ethan
