The object of a fencing bout (what an individual &amp;ldquo;game&amp;rdquo; is called) is to land a specified number of touches on your opponent before he/she scores that number on you. Each bout is officiated by a referee called a director.
Electric Scoring All official tournaments are conducted using electric scoring systems. The fencers connect themselves, their blades, and their metal jackets (lames) to a retractable cord (reel), which plugs in to a scoring machine (pictured left).</description></item><item><title>Join</title><link>https://www.um-fencing.com/join/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2016 14:00:17 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.um-fencing.com/join/</guid><description>Already attended a practice?
