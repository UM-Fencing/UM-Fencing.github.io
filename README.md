# University of Michigan Fencing Club Website

This is the new (first deployed July 2016) website for the University of Michigan Fencing Club.
It is a static site generated by [Hugo][hugo] and uses the [club-theme][club-theme] (now included in this repository as of August 2022) as a theme.

This compiled site is available at [https://www.um-fencing.com/](https://www.um-fencing.com/).

## Purpose
The previous version of this site, which heavily influenced the aesthetics of this site, was difficult to edit and update due to being made without a static site generator.
This new website is much easier to edit, thanks to Hugo's templating functionality, and this means updating the roster and adding results, for example, won't be such a painful process in the future.

## Set-up
Download this repository:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:UM-Fencing/UMFC-website
```
or using HTTPS:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/UM-Fencing/UMFC-website
```

*You should also [install Hugo][hugo install] if you have not already done so!*

## Editing
To update the site's content, edit (or create) the files available in `content/`.
Use Markdown where possible and HTML when necessary.
(Remember, writing HTML in Markdown files is OK!)
Sentences should be separated by line breaks for git's sake.

Images should be contained in `static/img/` and can be referenced from non-index files with `../img/<filename>`.
(From `_index.md`, refer to images as `img/<filename>`.)

To change site-wide features (e.g., default jumbotron image, practice times, site title), edit `config.toml`.

## Deploying
After making changes, testing, and committing, simply `git push` to the master branch of the UM-Fencing.github.io repository.
The website will automatically be deployed through GitHub Actions.
All generated website content is available on the gh-pages branch of the UM-Fencing.github.io repository.
Please note that deploying the website may take a few minutes.
